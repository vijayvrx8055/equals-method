## equals() method in java
-------------------------------------
1. Used to **comare two objects**
2. Returns **boolean** value based on comparison
3. Each class inherits the equals() method from object class
4. If we want to compare the object's own equality condition, then we have to override equals(Object obj) method.
5. It is always recommended if we want to override equals() method, then we must override the hashCode() method.
6. Default implementation of equals() method compares only the references.
